# 🎶 Hi! My name is Szymon
I'm a student from Poland currently studying Computer Engineering at the Faculty of Information and Communication Technology at the [Wrocław University of Technology](https://pwr.edu.pl/en/).
🔍 I want to expand my knowledge and gain experience in my first job/internship.
I love checking out new technologies and programming languages. I try to be an engineer, not just a programmer.
<br><b> I would love to participate in any Swift/Rust-related project </b>
## Currently working on
- [Chessblazer](https://github.com/SzymonSergiusz/Chessblazer) - UCI-compatible Chess Engine in early development, fully written in Swift <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=swift" width="20px" height="20px" />
- My engineering thesis (no repo yet)
## My recent projects
- [KGP Urban Game](https://github.com/SzymonSergiusz/kgp-urban-game) - Fullstack application for an urban game made with Nuxt3/Vue + FastAPI/Python + PostgreSQL. You can check it out [here](https://koronagorpolskich.vercel.app/)! 
- [Space Impact Clone](https://github.com/SzymonSergiusz/SO2-space-threads-invader) - A minigame heavily inspired by an old Nokia 3310 game. Created with Python, Pygame and threads.py library. We even managed to win a small competition for the best game in the college classes' group
